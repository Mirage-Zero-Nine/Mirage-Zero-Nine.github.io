                <h3>First of all, what is Sanctorum?</h3>
                <p>Sanctorum implements a formally verified specification for generic enclaves on an in-order
                    multiprocessor system. It uses partitioned caches and ﬂushing of shared state on context switches to
                    provide isolation.
                    Sanctorum allows enclaves to share hardware resources for performance improvements, with no impact
                    by external code. Allows hardware to evolve separately from the software.
                <p>This paradigm also allows hardware to evolve separately from the software – the same
                    hardware with more powerful security monitor, or the security monitor with a different hardware
                    design, as long as it supports a minimal set of isolation mechanisms.</p>
                <p><span class="content-bold">Sanctorum requires hardware support.</span></p>

                <h3>Then, what is Enclave?</h3>
                <p>An enclave is an isolated process consisting of one or more threads and a exclusive allocation of
                    the machine resources needed by the process. One approach of Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)
                    that strongly isolated sensitive user-mode processes in a largely untrusted software environment.
                    Enclaves are designed to guarantee integrity and conﬁdentiality for private computations and data in
                    the presence of untrusted privileged software such as an OS or hypervisor.</p>

                <h3>Relationship between enclave and Sanctorum:</h3>
                <p>Sanctorum authenticates enclaves via a cryptographic measurement of their initial state to
                    guaranteeing isolated execution and private state. In other words, Sanctorum is the assurance of
                    enclave.</p>

                <h3>Enclave Execution Model</h3>
                <p>
                    Enclave cannot rely on the OS to transparently provide services. Operating system is not trusted as
                    it can perform denial of service or wholesale destruction of the enclave. This is reasonable,
                    because OS is designed to organize hardware resource. However, this is the same reason that
                    operation system can not be trusted. Hence, direct/indirect side effects of an enclave’s work is not
                    visible to untrusted software, including privileged system software (OS, hypervisor). Enclave is not
                    prevented from deliberately leaking its own secrets, as it is able to access resources shared with
                    it by the OS, leaking the timing of these accesses.
                </p>
                <p> Sanctorum <span class="content-bold">authenticates enclaves</span> via a cryptographic measurement
                    of their initial state.
                </p>

                <h3>Threat Mode</h3>
                <p>
                    Sanctorum assumes an insidious privileged software adversary able to subvert any software in order
                    to impersonate, tamper with, or inspect an enclave. The speciﬁc abilities of the modelled adversary
                    to inspect enclaves via indirect means, such as cache tag state or availability of other shared
                    resources, depends on the availability of isolated protection domains for these surfaces in the
                    hardware platform.
                </p>
                <p>Denial of service is impossible to defend against in this setting, and is therefore not considered.
                    Note that even denial of service happened, it still won't change the integrity and confidentiality
                    of data that stored in the enclave.
                </p>
                <h3>Trust Assumed by Sanctorum</h3>
                <ul class="ordered-list">
                    <li>A <span class="content-bold">given enclave binary</span>, authenticated via a measurement of its
                        initial state taken by
                        Sanctorum.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="content-bold">Sanctorum’s binary image</span>, authenticated via a secure boot
                        protocol and endowed with unique
                        keys. This is covered by attestation.
                    </li>
                    <li>The hardware platform is <span class="content-bold">unconditionally trusted</span>.</li>
                    <li>A <span class="content-bold">trusted first party</span> is required to verify remote
                        attestations on enclave state. This process
                        requires a PKI to bootstrap trust in the hardware and Sanctorum.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Hardware is assumed trusted and requires it has the capability to do the cryptographic
                    measurement. Hence, it can be concluded that this Sanctorum is based on trusted hardware.</p>
