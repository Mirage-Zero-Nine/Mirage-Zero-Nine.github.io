Home page: [Blog](https://yyzhou95.github.io)

This repository contains blog's source code. It is a static page with minor Javascript code to accomplish some simple fucnctions.

Most of stylesheet is written on my own, with some basic layout (navbar) that is based on Bootstrap 4.

Mostly, I post notes of what I've learned from many fields. This blog is more like a draft notebook, and a place for practising CSS.

Enjoy!
